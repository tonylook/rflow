## Known Issues üêõ

Here's a list of known issues we're currently working on in `rflow`. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards resolving them.

### Issue with `rflow tag` on Main/Master Branch

- **Description**: Currently, the `rflow tag` command cannot be used on the main/master branch due to complications in managing automatic versioning for this type of action.
- **Impact**: This limitation affects the ability to tag releases directly from the main/master branch, which might be a part of some users' standard workflows.
- **Status**: I'm actively investigating ways to address this issue and hope to provide a solution in future updates. In the meantime, use the `rflow tag` command (as also compliant with Release Flow) on release branches for tagging releases.

I encourage users to report any other issues they encounter on our GitHub issues page to help me continue improving `rflow`.
