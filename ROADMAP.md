# 🗺️ rflow Development Roadmap

Breaking down the development project into incremental stages is essential for managing complexity and ensuring a robust, functional system. Below is the proposed plan, segmented into four distinct phases, each building on the previous one.

---

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (PoC) 🚀

### Objective
Develop a basic version of the `rflow` CLI tool with minimal features.

### Tasks
- 🛠️ **CLI Tool - Basic Structure:** Create a simple command-line interface using Python and the `click` library.
- 🌐 **Git Operations:** Implement basic Git operations using GitPython, focusing on branch creation (`rflow release`).
- ❗ **Error Handling:** Incorporate fundamental error checking and user-friendly messages.
- 📝 **Documentation:** Start documenting usage instructions and code.

### Deliverable
A CLI tool capable of creating a new release branch and pushing it to a remote repository.

---

## Phase 2: 50% Feature Completion 🌟

### Objective
Expand the CLI tool to include major release and fix branch creation.

### Tasks
- 🚧 **Major Release Branch Creation (`rflow major`):** Implement the logic for calculating and creating a major release branch.
- 🛠️ **Fix Branch Creation (`rflow fix`):** Add the functionality to create a fix branch from a release branch.
- 📈 **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improve error checking and messaging.
- 📚 **Documentation Update:** Update documentation to cover new features and usage scenarios.

### Deliverable
An enhanced `rflow` CLI tool capable of handling release, major release, and fix branches.

---

## Phase 3: 100% Feature Completion ✅

### Objective
Finalize the CLI tool and begin basic CI/CD pipeline integration.

### Tasks
- 🔖 **Tagging Release (`rflow tag`):** Implement tagging functionality in the CLI tool.
- 🛠️ **CI/CD Pipeline Script - Initial Setup:** Begin creating basic CI/CD pipeline scripts for Azure DevOps.
- 📖 **Version File Readability:** Ensure the `rflow` tool can read `version.info`.
- 📚 **Complete Documentation:** Finalize documentation, covering all features and technical details.

### Deliverable
A fully functional `rflow` CLI tool and a basic setup of CI/CD pipeline scripts in Azure DevOps.

---

## Phase 4: Integration with Azure DevOps Boards and Deployment 🌐

### Objective
Integrate the tool with Azure DevOps Boards and deploy issues.

### Tasks
- 🛠️ **CI/CD Pipeline Completion:** Finalize and refine CI/CD pipeline scripts, including version management, error handling, and logging.
- 🔄 **Azure DevOps Integration:** Integrate the pipeline with Azure DevOps Boards for tracking and management.
- 🧪 **Testing:** Develop and execute unit tests for both the CLI tool and CI/CD scripts.
- 📚 **Final Documentation and Training:** Provide comprehensive documentation and training materials.

### Deliverable
A fully integrated system with `rflow`, Azure DevOps Boards, and a complete set of CI/CD pipelines, along with thorough documentation and a tested, secure environment.
